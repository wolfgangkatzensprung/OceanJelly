# OceanJelly

Ocean Jelly is a 2D Roguelite for Android which combines survivors-like aspects with a more cozy, endless runner-type appeal. As a cute little jellyfish, you explore the depths of the endless ocean, finding treasures, dungeons and dangerous deep sea creatures who are not expecting a tiny jellyfish to disturb their eternal slumber.

It was made with Unity 2021.3 and was in development for around 2-3 months in the beginning of 2023 with a team of 1 engineer and 1 artist. The game has not yet been released.

## Features
- survivors-like combat and game progression system with 'passive' abilities
